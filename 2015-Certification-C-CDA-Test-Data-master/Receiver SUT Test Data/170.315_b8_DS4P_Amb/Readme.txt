The 170.315_b8_ds4p_*_sample1_*.xml contains test data that should be received by an SUT to enter into their system and then 
display the received C-CDA with all the DS4P markings.

The 170.315_b8_ds4p_*_sample2_*.xml contains test data that should be received by an SUT to enter into their system and then 
display the received C-CDA. Sample2 do not have any DS4P markings.

Recommended Order for files to be used
1. Provide sample2 to SUT to verify they can handle C-CDA's without privacy and security markings using DS4P.
2. Provide sample1 after that to verify that the newly received C-CDA does display the privacy and security markings.
